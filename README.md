#Degalleryify

A simple extension I developed to convert all imgur.com/gallery/hash links to i.imgur.com/hash.jpg

Originally developed for reddit, and best used in conjunction with [Hover Zoom +](https://github.com/extesy/hoverzoom)


All contributions or suggestions welcome - please note this is my first Chrome Extension and I'm not particularly familiar with Google Chrome's rule set/behaviors. Thanks!
