# Degallerify

A simple extension to convert all imgur.com/gallery/hash links to i.imgur.com/hash.jpg

Originally developed for reddit, and best used in conjunction with [Hover Zoom +](https://github.com/extesy/hoverzoom)

## Author Note

This was my first foray into JavaScript - the code is slow, cumbersome, and not the most efficient way of doing it. However, I am leaving it up for legacy purposes.
